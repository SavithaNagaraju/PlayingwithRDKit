1. Two main general tasks that many researchers face almost everyday are predicting physical,
 chemical and biochemical properties of a molecule by its general descriptors-chemical formula and 3D structure.
 and predicting chemical formula and 3D structure for an unknown molecule or substance with desirable properties
 respectively.
    They are QSAR(quantitative structure-activity relationship) and QSPR(quantitative structure property relationship).



Representation of chemical data
---------------------------------

To implement some machine learning in chemistry research.
1.  How to represent a data in a way that keeps much information.
2. When it comes to chemical formulas, in chemoinformatics there're several general ways of representation.

SMILES(Simplefied Molecular Input Line Entry System)
-------------------------------------------------------

1. The idea is to use simple line notations for chemical formulas that are based on some rules.
2. Atoms of chemical elements are represented by chemical symbols in capital letter, hydrogen is usually ignored.
3. Single bonds are not displayed, but double triple and quadruple bonds we shall use '=', '#', '$' repectively.
4. Atoms that are bonded must stand nearby.
5. Ring structures are written by breaking each ring at an arbitrary point to make a straight non-ring structure and
adding numerical ring closure labels to show connectivity between non-adjacent atoms.
6. Aromacity is commonly illustrated by writing the constituent B, C, N, O, P and S atoms in lower-case forms b, c,
n, o, p and s respectively.


MDL Molfile
------------

1. It's a file format that keeps information about the atoms, bonds, connectivity and coordinates of a molecule.
2. Typical MOL consists of some header information, the Connection Table containing atom info, then bond connections
 and types, followed by sections for more complex information.
3. MOL representations can either hold information about 2D or 3D structure of the molecule.
